                        krn is a minimal unikernel based on Linux with an accompanying custom network stack intended to be used for cluster operations. krn accepts statically compiled payloads from the xstatic toolchain to execute on bare hardware. It also features an optimizing scheduler which schedules process threading based on CPU bus bandwidth.

                        Flow was a web based content delivery network like PeerCDN, which leveraged the network bandwidth of active users on the website to serve content to the people still loading the website. A cacheable resource could be added to a page by adding a data-cache attribute to the linked resource in the HTML tag.

                Minux is a hobby Operating System that I created  in order to understand how Operating Systems work interally. It features a working display driver, interrupt control, multi-processing and Keyboard Support. It forms the basis  for xstatic/krn, a project I worked on later based on the Linux Kernel.

                krn is a minimal unikernel based on Linux with an accompanying custom network stack intended to be used for cluster operations. krn accepts statically compiled payloads from the xstatic toolchain to execute on bare hardware. It also features an optimizing scheduler which schedules process threading based on CPU bus bandwidth.

                SimpleCI is a Continuous Integration Server for Android Phones that I made on my Nexus 5. It makes use of ngrok to expose the local server to the internet, and uses Github Webhooks to download when a merge is pushed. It then uses the make command to build the binary before assigning a build status to the specific branch.
